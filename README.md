# Remote Patient Monitoring Dashboard



## What will the application do?

The Remote Patient Monitoring Dashboard application will enable healthcare providers or caregivers to remotely track and monitor the health status of patients. It helps in managing patients with chronic conditions or those who need continuous supervision by collecting and displaying health data, generating alerts, and providing insights into the patient's condition.


## Who will use it?

The Remote Patient Monitoring Dashboard could potentially be used by healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients. Healthcare providers could use it to monitor patient health remotely and receive alerts for critical conditions. Caregivers, including family members, use it to keep track of a loved oneâ€™s health status and ensure timely care. Patients themselves use it to monitor their health metrics and communicate more effectively with their healthcare team.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project interests me because it allows me to apply my passion for healthcare in a meaningful way. By developing tools that enable remote monitoring, I aim to make healthcare more accessible and efficient, particularly for those who need continuous supervision. This project aligns with my goal of leveraging technology to improve patient care and outcomes.
